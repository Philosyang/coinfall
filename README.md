# Virtual Piggy Bank ðŸª™

A fun p5.js app that simulates a virtual piggy bank where coins fall from the sky based on your hourly wage!

## How to Run

1. Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter your hourly wage in dollars
3. Click "Start" to watch coins fall
4. Click anywhere to toggle stats display
5. Refresh the page to reset

## How It Works

- Enter your hourly wage (e.g., 15.50 for $15.50/hour)
- Coins fall from the top representing your **actual** earnings with realistic timing
- **Smart coin dispensing**: The app tracks your expected earnings vs. coins dispensed, and drops coins to catch up
- **Realistic timing**: If you make $60/hour ($1/minute), coins drop at intervals that make sense
- Different coin types with intelligent selection:
  - ðŸª™ Penny (1Â¢) - bronze
  - ðŸª™ Nickel (5Â¢) - silver  
  - ðŸª™ Dime (10Â¢) - silver
  - ðŸª™ Quarter (25Â¢) - silver
  - ðŸª™ Dollar (100Â¢) - gold
- Coins stack up permanently with realistic physics
- Track the gap between expected vs. dispensed earnings in real-time
